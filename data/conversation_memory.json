They are not physical veins or nerves but are considered part of the subtle energy body. There are said to be thousands of nadis, but three are considered the most important:\n\n    *   **Ida:** The lunar nadi, associated with the left side of the body, representing feminine energy, coolness, and mental processes.\n    *   **Pingala:** The solar nadi, associated with the right side of the body, representing masculine energy, heat, and physical activity.\n    *   *...",
